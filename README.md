# MDP & MC Toolkit

This repository contains tools for working with **Markov Chains (MC)** and **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**. It includes methods for visualization, simulation, model checking, and reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

We recommend using `conda` to manage dependencies and isolate the environment.

### 1. Create a new environment

```bash
conda create -n mdp_env python=3.10
conda activate mdp_env
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install core packages from conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cvxpy matplotlib numpy
```

Install other packages via pip (e.g. `pymdptoolbox` is not available on conda):

```bash
pip install pymdptoolbox imageio
```

### 3. (Optional) Export environment

To share your setup:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To recreate:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `visu.py` | Visualization tools for MDPs and Markov Chains. Helps generate diagrams or plots of the state transitions. |
| `simulation.py` | Simulates the evolution of a Markov Chain over time. Also generates a **GIF animation** showing how the system's state changes. |
| `model_checking.py` | Contains model checking techniques for **Markov Chains (MC)** including:<br>â€¢ Symbolic methods<br>â€¢ Iterative techniques<br>â€¢ Monte Carlo simulation<br>â€¢ Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) |
| `mdp_model_checking.py` | Performs model checking specifically for **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**. |
| `renforcment.py` | Implements **Reinforcement Learning** to find optimal policies for MDPs using techniques such as value iteration or Q-learning. |

## ðŸ§  Dependencies

- `pymdptoolbox`: For MDP modeling and solving
- `cvxpy`: Convex optimization library used in some model checking algorithms
- `imageio`: For generating GIFs from simulation frames
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`: General-purpose math and plotting libraries

## ðŸš€ Usage

You can run any script as:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Make sure to activate the environment before you do:

```bash
conda activate mdp_env
```
